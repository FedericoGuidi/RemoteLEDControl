This is a quick demonstration of the Zerynth ecosystem. This demo lets you manage an RGB LED via WiFi with your smartphone, thanks to the Zerynth App and a NodeMCU v2 board programmed with Python.

The full guide is available here on Hackster \**link coming soon*\*

These are the basic steps:
- Download Zerynth Studio
- Register for a free account
- Run Zerynth Studio and connect the NodeMCU v2
- Register and virtualize the device
- Download the repository and create a new project with the files
